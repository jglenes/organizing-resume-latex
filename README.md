# Organizing Resume

This is a repository for my organizing resume.

## Requirements

* [XeTeX/XeLaTeX](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=xetex): When compiling this document, don't use pdfLaTeX -- it won't work. I'm using custom fonts throughout the document, which aren't supported (very well) by pdfLaTeX.
* [Lato (Google Web Font)](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato)
* [Lora (Google Web Font)](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lora)
